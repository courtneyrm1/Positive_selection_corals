#This is the pipeline I used in bash to detect positive selection of immune genes across multiple transcriptomes. Throughtout the pipeline filenames and transcript
headers need to be modified repeatedly. I tried to keep to the format Species_geneid, changing only when a program required different formats. Its important that
the headers stay consistent between files. It was difficult to keep track of the scripts to modify these, but I will add some of the scripts I used at the end of the pipeline.

#To make things easier I moved each transcriptome and BLAST results to a separate folder for each species and repeated the next steps separate for each species.

#4. gene #.fa w/ transcript hit annotated (>Transcript_4446_Cd_1JF2) #Cd is just example abbv for your species name

sure to trim names again after to orthogroupname.tree

the script:
